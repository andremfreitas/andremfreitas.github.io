Hi!!

I'm a PhD student in Physics at the University of Rome "Tor Vergata" and at Institut Polythecnic Paris (I am currently in Rome). I am supervised by [Luca Biferale](https://biferale.web.roma2.infn.it/) in Rome and [Kiwon Um](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/kum/) and [Mathieu Desbrun](https://www.inria.fr/en/mathieu-desbrun) in Paris. The research is funded by the European Union, via the Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) programme. My research focus on closure problems in fluid dynamics and turbulence through the integration of differentiable solvers into the learning process of deep neural networks. 

<!-- Before this, I did my MSc in Aerospace Engineering at TU Delft, with a focus on numerical methods for fluid dynamics. I did my thesis at the Nuclear Research & consultancy Group (NRG) in Petten, supervised by [Alexander van Zuijlen](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/a.h.vanzuijlen/?cHash=ca8aca12e38995f190218464bde31b5b) and [Kevin Zwijsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-zwijsen-86432810b/?originalSubdomain=nl). We worked on an in-house anisotropic pressure fluctuations model with application to fluid-structure interaction problems in the context of nuclear reactors. -->

My main research interest is Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) with applications in (computational) fluid dynamics.
Besides that, I am more generally interested in computational and theoretical approaches to studying turbulence. I'm also interested in Deep Learning and its many subareas.

Feel free to reach out if you have any research interests in common :)
